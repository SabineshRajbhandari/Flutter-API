## Features

- Clean, scalable project structure
- Example RESTful API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Reusable API service layer
- JSON model serialization/deserialization
- Error and loading state management
- Responsive UI with Flutter widgets
- Uses popular packages including [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http), [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), and more

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (latest stable)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (bundled with Flutter)
- IDE (VS Code/Android Studio/IntelliJ) recommended
- Android/iOS emulator or a physical device

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SabineshRajbhandari/Flutter-API.git
   cd Flutter-API
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

## API Integration Guide

This template follows best practices for consuming REST APIs in Flutter:

1. **HTTP Networking**  
   Using the [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package for making API requests.

2. **Centralized Endpoints**  
   Define all base URLs and endpoints in `lib/constants/api_constants.dart` for easy management.

3. **Model Classes**  
   Use Dart classes with `fromJson`/`toJson` to parse API responses.

4. **API Service Layer**  
   Keep API logic in `lib/services/` and isolate from UI code.

5. **State Management**  
   Powered by `provider` for clean separation of business logic and UI.

#### Example GET Request

```
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

// Example: Fetch data from API
Future fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    return MyModel.fromJson(json.decode(response.body));
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to load data');
  }
}
```

---

## Running the App

- Start your emulator or connect a device.
- Run the app using:
  ```
  flutter run
  ```
- The default app displays data fetched from a sample REST API.

---

## Configuration

- Manage all API endpoints and any configuration options in `lib/constants/api_constants.dart`.
- For sensitive settings (like API keys), use `.env` files or safe storage.
- **Do not** commit secret keys or credentials to your repository.

---

## Customization

- Change endpoints and models to suit your backend.
- Add new screens by following the modular structure.
- Expand business logic and UI features as needed!

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency errors:** Run `flutter pub get` in project root to refresh dependencies.
- **API/network issues:** Ensure valid endpoints and a stable internet connection.
- **UI problems:** Use Flutter's hot reload and debug console for widget errors.
